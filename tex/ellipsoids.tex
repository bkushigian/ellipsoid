We are all familiar with the definition of an ellipse from
calculus, namely the set of points satisfying
%
\[\left(\frac xa\right)^2 + \left(\frac yb\right)^2 \leq 1.\]
%
This form, of course, does not completely characterize ellipses since we need to
handle rotational symmetries and translations, but it's enough to get us
started. We turn these constraints into a matrix

\[\left(\begin{matrix}x&y\end{matrix}\right)
  \left(\begin{matrix}a^{-2} &0\\0&b^{-2}\end{matrix}\right)
    \left(\begin{matrix}x\\t\end{matrix}\right)\leq 1
\]
