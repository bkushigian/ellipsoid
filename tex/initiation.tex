\section{Initialization of the Ellipsoid Method}
Our second motivating question is ``how do we find an initial ellipsoid''? For
the basic ellipsoid method we are assuming that \(P\) is bounded and
full-dimensional, but it turns out that neither of these assumptions are needed
in the fully general case.\\

In a perfect world we would have explicit bounds for each of our \(x_i\), say
\(l_i \leq x_i \leq u_i\). If we do have this then we can take \(R\) to be
%
\[R := \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \max\{u_i^2, l_i^2\}}.\]
%
Unfortunately the world isn't perfect\footnote{as evidenced by Emacs users (go
Vim)} and we need a more general approach. In this case we use the
\textit{encoding length} of \(C\) and \(d\), denoted \(\langle C, d\rangle\).
\todo{offer proof? this seems cool and I'd like to understand it better.}
