# Notes from Prez Practice
* Three main parts:
    1. Introduction/intuition
    2. Middle Theory
    3. Complexity

## Chris: Complexity
* "Name" objects that we are working with (A_0 could be "Our initial matrix")
* Clarity: "we have to square n so we don't worry about irrationality"
* Put encoding lengths here? This is basically complexity stuff, so it maybe
  fits
* Lead math with high level notions
* (BEN) Make sure to include things needed for the complexity in the explanation
  of the cut (such as b, etc)
* Something about substituting `a_k into Cx < d`
* Always have 'defs' on board (if we use `n`, have {x \in \R^n})

* k : number of steps (maybe call it current step?)
* initial transformation: not sure I followed

## Jimmy
* Name strong nonemptiness problem
* Look into strong non-emptiness vs week nonemptiness
* Take more time explaining cuts/smaller ellipsoids
* Arrow `E_k+1 <- f(E_k)` is backwards?
* Return witness along with non-empty
* Return "EMPTY" at the end of the method
* Pause after writing pseudocode
* Dot product: not the dot product

## Ben
* Assume inputs are integral
